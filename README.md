# Cats vs Dogs
### Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

Having had both dogs and cats in our family for many years, I can confidently tell the difference between the two. Yet, many pet-focused websites still struggle to distinguish between them when users are setting up profiles for their pets.

While booking a stay for our pets before a family vacation, I was asked to upload photos of each pet one by one and manually label them. This old-school approach not only felt tedious — it also seemed like a missed opportunity to create a smarter, more delightful user experience.

Imagine if the website could instantly recognize whether a photo showed a dog or a cat, saving users time and making the site feel more modern and intuitive.

The goal of my project is to build an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically predict whether an uploaded image contains a dog or a cat — helping pet websites level up their onboarding process with a little help from deep learning.

### Project Outline

To find the best-performing model, I will start with the simplest approach: manually building a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras and tuning it by hand.

Next, I will leverage Keras Tuner to automate the search for the best hyperparameters, allowing the model to improve through guided experimentation.

Finally, I will take advantage of transfer learning by using the well-established pre-trained model ResNet50V2 — building on the shoulders of giants to further boost performance and accelerate training.
